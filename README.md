This scraper was created and run as part of the process of gathering data for
the "business environments" graduate management course at the Berlin School of
Economics and Law.

The script provides a general look at regional steel competitiveness using
archives of weekly production data from the American Iron and Steel Institute.

The script was partially generated using a coding assistant tool.

The output shows weekly steel numbers for a given range of times, with months
that contain multiple weekly Wayback snapshots giving an average of those weekly
snapshot numbers.
